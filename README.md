# BookReviewer
Website I created for my final project for the Computer Science class in my high school. The user can find reviews for different books, series and authors and details about them. The website is also linked to a database and provides user interface to be able to insert their own book reviews into the back-end through the website.

I did this project on my own, using mainly HTML with CSS/JS working with the database with MySQL, and some PHP for the connections.

The website can also be found at http://info.tm.edu.ro:8088/~mborsos/atestat/
